# Contributing to Scientific Image Forgery Detection

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This guide will help you get started.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/giovanimds/kaggle---Recod.ai-LUC---Scientific-Image-Forgery-Detection.git
cd kaggle---Recod.ai-LUC---Scientific-Image-Forgery-Detection
```

2. Install uv (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
make install-dev
# or
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

We use:
- **Black** for code formatting
- **Ruff** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

Format your code before committing:
```bash
make format
# or
black src/ tests/
ruff check --fix src/ tests/
```

### Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
make test
# or
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src
```

Write tests for new features in the `tests/` directory.
